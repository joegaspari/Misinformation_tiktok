Apparently, there was a strange XMRV virus spreading, and the virus, Judy Mirovits claimed, could be treated with a type of HIV medication. But other researchers failed to recreate Judy Mikovits startling results, and two years later the journal withdrew the article after researchers found that Judy Mikovits' results were simply due to coincidence, and therefore her results were not to be trusted. In the interview, however, Judy Mikovits says that you are even at risk of getting sick if you use face mask. Nonsense, experts say. If you are infected, you cannot become more or less infected.
